I had my own room at Aunt June’s.  It was no bigger than a nook, really, but I felt more comfortable there than in my room at Momma’s house.  The slanted ceilings were plastered with sun-faded posters of rock ‘n’ roll legends and old movies, and I could spend hours up there memorizing taglines and billings, studying the untamed curls of ‘60’s hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that morning, I had few moments of peace before Aunt June’s story from the night before flooded my head and rushed into my chest, threatening to burst through my lungs.  I needed to know what happened with Marianne.  Obviously, my momma had emerged relatively unscathed from whatever had happened, but that didn’t diminish my concern over the whole thing.  Just the idea of someone doing some sort of spell on my family member—and a seemingly harmful spell at that—chilled me somewhere deep inside, somewhere unknown that could therefore never be warmed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tiptoed over to Aunt June’s room, stomach twisting.  I had to convince her to tell me the rest of her story.  Stepping gingerly through her doorway, I could hear her lightly snoring.  One thick arm was thrust across her face to block out the morning light.  It was always a relief to see that Aunt June was okay in the morning.  Ever since her heart attack two years ago, I had been constantly terrified of finding her in the morning, stiff and without breath.  I made my way over to her side of the bed and gently shook her shoulder.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Aunt June.”  I said, and shook the shoulder a little more.  “Aunt JUNE.  Wake up!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes opened slowly, reluctantly.  She groaned a little when she saw my expectant face.  “Karlie, you’re not going to start that nonsense again about what we were talking about last night.  I was just talkin’,” she mumbled, turning her face away from the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said, starting to get annoyed.  “That wasn’t just nonsense.  You were totally serious, Aunt June,” I said.  “Please, tell me what happened with Momma and Marianne.  You can’t just tell me all that and then not finish the story.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aunt June turned her head and looked at me.  Her gray eyes looked very old and weathered.  Like she had seen too much, more than anybody should in a lifetime.  She shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Come on, then, you little shit,” she said.  “Let me make you breakfast, and I’ll tell you the rest of the story.  But don’t blame me if it’s not what you wanted to hear.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So as you know, your momma was a cheerleader in high school.  I know nowadays, most of the popular girls in your school play volleyball and soccer, but back then, cheerleading was THE thing to be in if you were a girl to be reckoned with.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, I never went to football games or anything of the sort.  I was more interested in staying in my room and sewin’, makin’ things.  Your momma used to make my life a livin’ hell because I was just a fat girl who stayed in her room and sewed stupid shit, accordin’ to her.  But I guess in the end, my hobby did me more good than your momma’s hobby did her, though.  At least I made a career out of it.  Just keep that in mind next time someone makes fun of you for likin’ to read your science books or doin’ your chemisty experiments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, so one Friday night, not too long after that strange day at Marianne’s grandmother’s house, I was sittin’ in my room workin’ on a dress or somethin’, when all of a sudden, the doorbell rang.  My parents were out to dinner, so I ran down the stairs to get the door.  It was Marianne.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She asked if I could come over to her house.  I couldn’t believe it.  For the moment, I had forgotten all about the creepy visit to her grandmother’s house, and was just wrapped up in the excitement that a friend wanted to spend time with me.  I threw on my jacket—it was late fall, and a little chilly out—and we walked over to her house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marianne let us in real quick, like she was tryin’ to close out the cold outside.  I started to hang up my jacket on the coat hook by the door, but she stopped me, grabbin’ my arm and pullin’ me upstairs.  I asked her what she was in such a hurry for, but she just told me that she wanted to show me somethin’.  All of a sudden, I started to think back to that day at her grandmother’s, all the chantin’ and the symbols and not least of all, the dagger.  I was gettin’ more and more nervous as we walked up the stairs and into her room.  She told me her parents were away for the weekend, and that it was just us there.  That particular piece of news didn’t make me feel any better, as you can probably imagine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She sat on her bed and her eyes shined with excitement.  I took a seat on the threadbare rug on her floor, lookin’ up at her and waitin’ for her to show me whatever she was going to show me, when I noticed the little silver knife shinin’ in her hand.  I scrambled to my feet and backed up toward the doorway, my hand clutchin’ the doorknob so tight I thought my fingers was gonna fall off.  Marianne looked at me, confused.  She told me that we was finally gettin’ back at my sister for all the pain she caused everyone around her.  I said that if her revenge involved usin’ that knife, then I was having nothin’ to do with her.  I started to tell her that I would not let her hurt herself, my sister, me, or anyone else, when she interrupted me by shovin’ the dagger into her stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine jammin’ a knife full force into a half-baked potato with a real thick skin, and you have an approximation of what the dagger piercin’ her stomach sounded like.  I screamed, unable to do anything but watch as deep red blood soaked her clothing and pooled onto her bed.  She pulled out the knife with a terrible squelchin’ sound and drove it into her neck.  Everything around her turned crimson.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I finally found my voice and screamed at her to stop.  But to my horror, she just started laughing and stabbin’ herself, blood pourin’ out of her mouth like water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then she sputtered out, “Didn’t you hear what my grandmother said?  I’m a human voodoo doll.  Anything I do to myself with this knife happens to your sister, and as long as she dies first, my injuries heal right away and just leave scars.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I was overcome with the horrible implications of what she said.  If the spell had worked, and she was a human voodoo doll with my sister as her proxy, then my sister would surely die first due to the exertion of her cheerleadin’ at the game.  Her heart would be pumpin’ so much faster than Marianne’s that she would bleed to death much faster, leaving Marianne unharmed and my sister dead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I remembered what Marianne said.  Anything that she did to herself with the knife would happen to my sister.  But what about other weapons?  After all, whoever died first would cause the other to remain unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even hesitate as I grabbed the typewriter sitting on Marianne’s desk and lugged it over to her bed.  She didn’t notice me strugglin’ as I raised it up as high as I could and brought it down on her head.  There was so much blood already, I couldn’t tell how much of it was from the impact and how much was from her stabbing frenzy.  I raised it up and brought it down again, again, again, too many times to count, lost in my singular goal of saving my sister.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marianne had long stopped movin’ before I stopped with the typewriter.  When I was done, I wiped off the damn thing and the doorknob with some tissues from her desk, stuffed the rags in my pocket, wrapped myself in a bathrobe from her closet to hide my bloodstained clothes, and went home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stared at my aunt, mouth agape.  I was sure my face was as pale as the moon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The people who was at the game won’t admit what they witnessed that night.  I know that the part of the field your momma was on was coated in blood, and lots of people was admitted to the hospital for psychiatric treatment because of what they saw.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And?”  I said, still in shock at what I had heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And the hospital convinced them that it was some sort of mass hallucination, some type of hysteria induced by crowds,” Aunt June said.  “They cleaned up the blood off the field, the people were discharged from the hospital, and nobody mentioned it again.  Except me.  And that’s why—”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And that’s why people call you a liar,” I said, finishing her sentence.  The scrambled eggs on my plate were freezing cold by now and hardening into little yellow balls, as if trying to disappear into themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aunt June nodded.  “And your momma and I never talked about it.  I don’t think she has any idea what happened to her that night, or how her wounds shriveled up into little scars just a few minutes after they appeared.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought of the scar on Momma’s neck, and how she rubbed it when she talked about Aunt June.  “I think she knows what happened,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Maybe so,” Aunt June replied.  “Maybe she made the connection when your daddy died.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?”  I asked, my muscles tightening at the very thought of the abusive, evil bastard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You know how he died from a heart attack, the same day I had mine?”  Aunt June said.  “I took some very special pills that day.  Pills that turned me into, for lack of a better term, a human voodoo doll.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked at her, suddenly understanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daddy’s body, after years of alcohol and drug abuse, was much weaker than Aunt June’s.  And so he died first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got up, went over to Aunt June, and hugged her tight, thanking her for saving me and my momma once again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

After all, whoever died first would cause the other to remain unharmed.\n\nI didn’t even hesitate as I grabbed the typewriter sitting on Marianne’s desk and lugged it over to her bed.  She didn’t notice me strugglin’ as I raised it up as high as I could and brought it down on her head.  There was so much blood already, I couldn’t tell how much of it was from the impact and how much was from her stabbing frenzy.  I raised it up and brought it down again, again, again, too many times to count, lost in my singular goal of saving my sister.  \n\nMarianne had long stopped movin’ before I stopped with the typewriter.  When I was done, I wiped off the damn thing and the doorknob with some tissues from her desk, stuffed the rags in my pocket, wrapped myself in a bathrobe from her closet to hide my bloodstained clothes, and went home.\n\n***\n\nI stared at my aunt, mouth agape.  I was sure my face was as pale as the moon.\n\n“The people who was at the game won’t admit what they witnessed that night.  I know that the part of the field your momma was on was coated in blood, and lots of people was admitted to the hospital for psychiatric treatment because of what they saw.”\n\n“And?”  I said, still in shock at what I had heard.\n\n“And the hospital convinced them that it was some sort of mass hallucination, some type of hysteria induced by crowds,” Aunt June said.  “They cleaned up the blood off the field, the people were discharged from the hospital, and nobody mentioned it again.  Except me.  And that’s why—”\n\n“And that’s why people call you a liar,” I said, finishing her sentence.  The scrambled eggs on my plate were freezing cold by now and hardening into little yellow balls, as if trying to disappear into themselves.\n\nAunt June nodded.  “And your momma and I never talked about it.  I don’t think she has any idea what happened to her that night, or how her wounds shriveled up into little scars just a few minutes after they appeared.”\n\nI thought of the scar on Momma’s neck, and how she rubbed it when she talked about Aunt June.  “I think she knows what happened,” I said.\n\n“Maybe so,” Aunt June replied.  “Maybe she made the connection when your daddy died.”\n\n“What do you mean?”  I asked, my muscles tightening at the very thought of the abusive, evil bastard.\n\n“You know how he died from a heart attack, the same day I had mine?”  Aunt June said.  “I took some very special pills that day.  Pills that turned me into, for lack of a better term, a human voodoo doll.”\n\nI looked at her, suddenly understanding.\n\nDaddy’s body, after years of alcohol and drug abuse, was much weaker than Aunt June’s.  And so he died first.\n\nI got up, went over to Aunt June, and hugged her tight, thanking her for saving me and my momma once again.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that there are such things as irreducibly normative moral facts. &lt;em&gt;Sui generis&lt;/em&gt; facts about what one ought to do, about what&amp;#39;s right, about what&amp;#39;s good, and so on. If there were such facts, though, they would surely be very much unlike the other sorts of facts in our lives. They would be radically different from facts like “the sun rises in the east,” “avocados are 99¢ a pound,” or “the earth is roughly 4.4 billion years old.” So strange and different would they be that claims to their existence would be objectionable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the essence of a queerness argument: that the realist’s moral facts are queer in such a way that counts against realism. However, the realist may rightly ask what it is about moral facts that is so queer. Wherein lies the queerness? In response to this question Olson 2014 has refined four queerness arguments from Mackie’s original passage (just a few pages from &lt;em&gt;Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong&lt;/em&gt;), only one of which Olson himself finds compelling. I’ll be summarizing my interpretation of Olson’s four arguments here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before we get into those arguments, though, let’s be clear about the target of queerness arguments: robust moral realism. Though the term is somewhat new, robust realists (aka moral non-naturalists) have a history going back to the early 1900s. Putting it as broadly as possible the robust realists think that some atomic moral sentences (e.g. the bombing of Hiroshima was wrong) are true in a non-trivial sense. Furthermore these moral claims owe their truth to some mind-independent facts which are not reducible to any physical states of affairs. In this sense robust realist are distinct from so-called moral naturalists, who hold that moral facts can be made sense of by referring only to some set of facts about the natural world. Queerness arguments are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; targeted at moral naturalism. Although moral error theorists like Mackie or Olson must think that there are some separate grounds to dismiss naturalism in order to preserve their error theory, that won’t be the subject of this thread. For future reference whenever I say “moral realism” below I mean “robust moral realism.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervenience is Queer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Virtually all moral realists agree that moral facts supervene upon natural facts. The supervenience relation is just one such that &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; supervenes upon &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; just in case any change in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; necessarily is accompanied by a change in &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;. To put it another way it is impossible for their to be a change in &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; without there also being a change in &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;. So ripeness might be said to supervene upon the physical makeup of an apple. As the apple’s cells change, so does the apple’s ripeness. Importantly, there can be no change in the apple’s ripeness without a change in the its physical makeup. In the case of morality we might say that certain moral properties like “being harmed” supervene upon various physical states of affairs, whether they be a dagger plunged into one’s chest, pain-like brain states, or what have you. There is no change in moral properties without a corresponding change in the physical world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus the moral realist holds that there are unique moral properties and that these properties, while not themselves natural properties, supervene upon natural properties. In holding this, however, the realist falls afoul of a principle in metaphysics known as Hume’s Dictum. Following Hume’s work on necessity, Hume’s Dictum might be summarized as: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(HD) There can be no necessary connections between distinct properties; all properties that necessarily covary are identical.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course the realist holds that moral properties and natural properties do necessarily covary, but that moral properties are not reducible to (or identical to) any natural properties. Thus the realist supposes and objectionably queer supervenience relation. We can enumerate the argument like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(S1) Moral properties and natural properties are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(S2) Moral properties supervene upon natural properties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(S3) However, supervenience is objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(S4) So the relation between moral and natural properties is objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(S5) If the relation between moral and natural properties is queer, then moral properties themselves are objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(S6) So moral properties are objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the face of it this seems like a very nice way of placing the queerness. After all premises S1 and S2 just follow from the content of moral realism, so the realist cannot wiggle out of the argument on the basis that it doesn’t apply to their view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This argument faces trouble, however, when it comes to Hume’s Dictum. Hume’s Dictum both has far-reaching consequences for fields beyond moral philosophy and it’s quite controversial in metaphysics alone, to say nothing of metaethics. A full discussion of the principle is too great a task for this thread, but we can characterize the fate of this queerness argument as follows: &lt;em&gt;at best the argument that moral supervenience is queer needs to be shelved pending resolution of the broader metaphysical issue and at worst its foundation crumbles for reasons independent of the debate about moral realism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral Knowledge is Queer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moral realists typically think that we know at least a few moral facts. For instance some of our common sense moral judgments are true. But if there is moral knowledge and moral facts aren’t merely natural facts, then it seems reasonable to say that moral knowledge would have to be synthetic &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge. Or knowledge that we come to have independent of experience and that isn’t merely knowledge about the definitions of things. The second queerness argument, then, can be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(K1) Moral knowledge is a variety of synthetic &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(K2) But synthetic &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge is objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(K3) So moral knowledge is a variety of knowledge that is objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(K4) So moral knowledge is objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don’t need to say much about how synthetic &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; knowledge may or may not be queer in order to see where this argument fails. As with the previous argument about supervenience, the fate of this argument rests on contentious issues beyond the metaethical debate alone. So once again we may say:  &lt;em&gt;at best the argument that moral knowledge is queer needs to be shelved pending resolution of the broader epistemological issue and at worst its foundation crumbles for reasons independent of the debate about moral realism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral Motivation is Queer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Plato has famously held that knowledge of the Form of the Good would provide the knower with overriding motivation to act in a way consistent with the Good. On this view it is not merely the &lt;em&gt;belief&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; is good which provides the believer with overriding motivation. It is &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; of the Good, where knowledge is factive. This raises a troubling question for the realist: what is it about knowledge in particular that produces overriding motivation to do what’s right? Well, given that the difference between mere belief and knowledge is that the latter is connected to the fact of the matter, the natural answer seems to be that it’s the fact itself that provides the motivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This seems very peculiar, though. After all the realist holds that moral facts are non-physical and don’t participate in the causal order of things. So how is it that the moral fact of the matter itself compels my body, a thing of flesh and blood, to move? Surely such a causal relationship between non-physical moral facts and my physical body would be objectionably queer. Thus we can enumerate this queerness argument as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(M1) Knowing some moral fact guarantees motivation in accordance with that fact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(M2) False moral beliefs don’t guarantee motivation in accordance with the belief.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(M3) If true moral beliefs guarantee motivation and false moral beliefs don’t, then the motivational force of moral knowledge is produced by the moral facts themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(M4) But this involves an objectionably queer relationship.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(M5) So moral facts are objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s little doubt in my mind that there’s something fishy about the thesis attributed to Plato. But is there any reason to think that contemporary realists should be committed to so strong a claim? Almost certainly not. There are a number of other options about motivation available to the realist. E.g. moral judgments (correct or not) necessarily motivate, moral judgments motivate only most of the time, moral judgments produce defeasible motivational force, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the Platonic thesis doesn’t seem to track our common sense notion of moral motivation. Namely that it’s possible for one to judge that something is wrong, but still do it. Presumably because they desire the outcome of the wrongful action more than they’re motivated by its wrongness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So while the third queerness argument doesn’t run into the problems that plague the first two, it does rest on claims that the realist is neither required nor obviously predisposed to accept.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irreducible Normativity is Queer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Given the failure of the previous three arguments it should come as no surprise that this is the argument which Olson takes to be successful. In order to frame this argument let&amp;#39;s first establish an analysis of normative reasons. We&amp;#39;ll say that S has a reason to ϕ just in case some fact F counts in favour of S&amp;#39;s ϕing. Here are some examples of moral reasons broken down in this way:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that my donating blood will save lives counts in favour of my donating blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that I can save a drowning child at minimal cost to myself counts in favour of my saving that child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Olson contends that these moral favouring relations are unlike other cases in which we take ourselves to have a reason. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that rules of chess restrict bishops to diagonal motions counts in favour of my only moving my rooks diagonally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that I desire to eat tuna counts in favour of my eating tuna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In these more mundane sorts of reasons Olson argues that the favouring relations are reducible to facts about chess, my preferences for food, and so on. Or, more broadly, they are reducible to facts about an agent&amp;#39;s desires, her roles, or various institutional norms that she submits herself to. The sort of reduction Olson has in mind is simply that normative claims of the reducible sort may be held to be true or false depending only on agent&amp;#39;s desires/institutional roles and whether or not the act in question satisfies these desires/institutional roles. Moral imperatives admit of no such reduction (according to the robust realist anyway) and so this irreducible favouring relation is metaphysically mysterious. Metaphysical mystery just is the essence of queerness, so moral facts require a queer relation. One last time we can enumerate the argument like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(N1) Moral facts requires the existence of irreducible favouring relations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(N2) But irreducible favouring relations are objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(N3) So moral facts require objectionably queer relations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(N4) So moral facts are objectionably queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Olson seems very aware that &amp;quot;queer&amp;quot; here is not irrevocably moving. That is, for those who find nothing objectionably queer at all about the metaphysics of irreducible normativity, there isn&amp;#39;t much else to be said in defense of the argument. For example, Shafer-Landau suggests in his 2003 book that we may simply have no choice but to embrace the metaphysical mystery of realism. Of course just as there isn’t much else to motivate the staunch realist of the troubles of queerness, neither is there much to be said on behalf of realism for one who does find this irreducible normativity queer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This may seem like a much less powerful argument than some anti-realists would like to have, but it might also be the best they can get. As well, this strikes me as being consistent with what’s suggested by Enoch in his 2011 book as the methodology of metaethics. There are no unassailable proofs in metaethics, he says. Rather, we must proceed forward by considering the available arguments and weighing the plausibility of the competing metaethical theories in light of all of these arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
          "selftext": "Suppose that there are such things as irreducibly normative moral facts. *Sui generis* facts about what one ought to do, about what's right, about what's good, and so on. If there were such facts, though, they would surely be very much unlike the other sorts of facts in our lives. They would be radically different from facts like “the sun rises in the east,” “avocados are 99¢ a pound,” or “the earth is roughly 4.4 billion years old.” So strange and different would they be that claims to their existence would be objectionable.\n\nThis is the essence of a queerness argument: that the realist’s moral facts are queer in such a way that counts against realism. However, the realist may rightly ask what it is about moral facts that is so queer. Wherein lies the queerness? In response to this question Olson 2014 has refined four queerness arguments from Mackie’s original passage (just a few pages from *Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong*), only one of which Olson himself finds compelling. I’ll be summarizing my interpretation of Olson’s four arguments here.\n\nBefore we get into those arguments, though, let’s be clear about the target of queerness arguments: robust moral realism. Though the term is somewhat new, robust realists (aka moral non-naturalists) have a history going back to the early 1900s. Putting it as broadly as possible the robust realists think that some atomic moral sentences (e.g. the bombing of Hiroshima was wrong) are true in a non-trivial sense. Furthermore these moral claims owe their truth to some mind-independent facts which are not reducible to any physical states of affairs. In this sense robust realist are distinct from so-called moral naturalists, who hold that moral facts can be made sense of by referring only to some set of facts about the natural world. Queerness arguments are *not* targeted at moral naturalism. Although moral error theorists like Mackie or Olson must think that there are some separate grounds to dismiss naturalism in order to preserve their error theory, that won’t be the subject of this thread. For future reference whenever I say “moral realism” below I mean “robust moral realism.”\n\n**Supervenience is Queer**\n\nVirtually all moral realists agree that moral facts supervene upon natural facts. The supervenience relation is just one such that *x* supervenes upon *y* just in case any change in *x* necessarily is accompanied by a change in *y*. To put it another way it is impossible for their to be a change in *x* without there also being a change in *y*. So ripeness might be said to supervene upon the physical makeup of an apple. As the apple’s cells change, so does the apple’s ripeness. Importantly, there can be no change in the apple’s ripeness without a change in the its physical makeup. In the case of morality we might say that certain moral properties like “being harmed” supervene upon various physical states of affairs, whether they be a dagger plunged into one’s chest, pain-like brain states, or what have you. There is no change in moral properties without a corresponding change in the physical world.\n\nThus the moral realist holds that there are unique moral properties and that these properties, while not themselves natural properties, supervene upon natural properties. In holding this, however, the realist falls afoul of a principle in metaphysics known as Hume’s Dictum. Following Hume’s work on necessity, Hume’s Dictum might be summarized as: \n\n(HD) There can be no necessary connections between distinct properties; all properties that necessarily covary are identical.\n\nOf course the realist holds that moral properties and natural properties do necessarily covary, but that moral properties are not reducible to (or identical to) any natural properties. Thus the realist supposes and objectionably queer supervenience relation. We can enumerate the argument like this:\n\n(S1) Moral properties and natural properties are distinct.\n\n(S2) Moral properties supervene upon natural properties.\n\n(S3) However, supervenience is objectionably queer.\n\n(S4) So the relation between moral and natural properties is objectionably queer.\n\n(S5) If the relation between moral and natural properties is queer, then moral properties themselves are objectionably queer.\n\n(S6) So moral properties are objectionably queer.\n\nOn the face of it this seems like a very nice way of placing the queerness. After all premises S1 and S2 just follow from the content of moral realism, so the realist cannot wiggle out of the argument on the basis that it doesn’t apply to their view.\n\nThis argument faces trouble, however, when it comes to Hume’s Dictum. Hume’s Dictum both has far-reaching consequences for fields beyond moral philosophy and it’s quite controversial in metaphysics alone, to say nothing of metaethics. A full discussion of the principle is too great a task for this thread, but we can characterize the fate of this queerness argument as follows: *at best the argument that moral supervenience is queer needs to be shelved pending resolution of the broader metaphysical issue and at worst its foundation crumbles for reasons independent of the debate about moral realism.*\n\n**Moral Knowledge is Queer**\n\nMoral realists typically think that we know at least a few moral facts. For instance some of our common sense moral judgments are true. But if there is moral knowledge and moral facts aren’t merely natural facts, then it seems reasonable to say that moral knowledge would have to be synthetic *a priori* knowledge. Or knowledge that we come to have independent of experience and that isn’t merely knowledge about the definitions of things. The second queerness argument, then, can be summarized as follows:\n\n(K1) Moral knowledge is a variety of synthetic *a priori* knowledge.\n\n(K2) But synthetic *a priori* knowledge is objectionably queer.\n\n(K3) So moral knowledge is a variety of knowledge that is objectionably queer.\n\n(K4) So moral knowledge is objectionably queer.\n\nWe don’t need to say much about how synthetic *a priori* knowledge may or may not be queer in order to see where this argument fails. As with the previous argument about supervenience, the fate of this argument rests on contentious issues beyond the metaethical debate alone. So once again we may say:  *at best the argument that moral knowledge is queer needs to be shelved pending resolution of the broader epistemological issue and at worst its foundation crumbles for reasons independent of the debate about moral realism.*\n\n**Moral Motivation is Queer**\n\nPlato has famously held that knowledge of the Form of the Good would provide the knower with overriding motivation to act in a way consistent with the Good. On this view it is not merely the *belief* that *x* is good which provides the believer with overriding motivation. It is *knowledge* of the Good, where knowledge is factive. This raises a troubling question for the realist: what is it about knowledge in particular that produces overriding motivation to do what’s right? Well, given that the difference between mere belief and knowledge is that the latter is connected to the fact of the matter, the natural answer seems to be that it’s the fact itself that provides the motivation.\n\nThis seems very peculiar, though. After all the realist holds that moral facts are non-physical and don’t participate in the causal order of things. So how is it that the moral fact of the matter itself compels my body, a thing of flesh and blood, to move? Surely such a causal relationship between non-physical moral facts and my physical body would be objectionably queer. Thus we can enumerate this queerness argument as follows:\n\n(M1) Knowing some moral fact guarantees motivation in accordance with that fact.\n\n(M2) False moral beliefs don’t guarantee motivation in accordance with the belief.\n\n(M3) If true moral beliefs guarantee motivation and false moral beliefs don’t, then the motivational force of moral knowledge is produced by the moral facts themselves.\n\n(M4) But this involves an objectionably queer relationship.\n\n(M5) So moral facts are objectionably queer.\n\nThere’s little doubt in my mind that there’s something fishy about the thesis attributed to Plato. But is there any reason to think that contemporary realists should be committed to so strong a claim? Almost certainly not. There are a number of other options about motivation available to the realist.

Namely that it’s possible for one to judge that something is wrong, but still do it. Presumably because they desire the outcome of the wrongful action more than they’re motivated by its wrongness.\n\nSo while the third queerness argument doesn’t run into the problems that plague the first two, it does rest on claims that the realist is neither required nor obviously predisposed to accept.\n\n**Irreducible Normativity is Queer**\n\nGiven the failure of the previous three arguments it should come as no surprise that this is the argument which Olson takes to be successful. In order to frame this argument let's first establish an analysis of normative reasons. We'll say that S has a reason to ϕ just in case some fact F counts in favour of S's ϕing.
